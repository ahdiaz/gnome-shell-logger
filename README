Abstract
--------

This program adds the ability of logging to a file the debug and error messages produced by GnomeShell and its extensions.
The log file is written in /tmp/gshell.log by default, but you can change this and other options editing the file logger.js

Installation and usage
----------------------

The program is intended to be used as a GnomeShell module, so you must copy the logger directory under
/usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ and include the module in main.js with this line:

    const Logger = imports.logger.logger;

All the messages sent to the default Gnome Shell logger, that is, calling global.log(), will also be send to
log4javascript.

You can also use the logger directly by calling the following methods:

global.logger.debug()
global.logger.info()
global.logger.warn()
global.logger.error()
global.logger.fatal()


Tip: If you want to see the messages produced by Gjs in gshell.log you can start GnomeShell this way from a tty:

    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell --replace 2&>>/tmp/gshell.log
